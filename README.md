# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
- In this project I have picked a data set from amazon reviews regarding video games and used Pyspark to perform the ETL process by extracting the data, transforming the data and connecting to the database that was generated for me through the AWS webserver. With the reviews my goal is to try and determine if there is favorable review bias from the Vine members of our data set.

## Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions:

## How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?

## How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

## What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

## Summary: In your summary, state if there is any positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. Use the results of your analysis to support your statement. Then, provide one additional analysis that you could do with the dataset to support your statement.
